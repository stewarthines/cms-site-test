# About

This is a project to build a website. I wanted to have a CMS and host it on GitHub Pages because that's cheap. 

# Process

I started by sketching in Figma. I began with a mobile layout and then moved to a desktop version. Once I had something I liked, I used ChatGPT to help me get Jekyll up and running.

I used variables to create a simple design system.
